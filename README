To install:

1. put the correct restore.img somewhere on the device
    - 'internal sd' is at /data/media
    - external sd is at /mnt/external_sd
    - usb drive is at /mnt/usbdrive
2. dd if=/path/to/recovery.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1
    - this installs the recovery
3. mount -o rw,remount /system
4. mv /system/etc/install-recovery.sh /system/etc/install-recovery.bak.sh
    - back up this file before we disable it
    - if you ever want your default recovery back just restore this file and reboot
5. echo "#!/system/bin/sh" > /system/etc/install-recovery.sh
    - this file will restore recovery to factory default at every boot, so needs to be disabled
6. mount -o ro,remount /system


To compile:

1. copy the device directory into your CyanogenMod system directory (often: ~/android/system)
2. open a shell at your CyanogenMod system directory
    - . build/envsetup.sh
    - lunch full_ventana-eng
    - make recoveryimage


Known issues:
    - on some systems /sdcard is not mounted or is not mounted rw. 
        workaround: use adb to mount /sdcard
